female_completion_rate:
    Primary completion rate is the percentage of female students completing the
    last year of primary school. It is calculated by taking the total number of
    female students in the last grade of primary school, minus the number of
    repeaters in that grade, divided by the total number of children of
    official graduation age. The ratio can exceed 100% due to over-aged and
    under-aged children who enter primary school late/early and/or repeat
    grades. United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization
    (UNESCO) Institute for Statistics.
